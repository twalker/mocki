## ðŸ˜Œ  mocki

A little server of mock json files for backbone models & collections.
It can be `use`ed  by an existing express app or run as a standalone server.

It serves json files in `test/fixtures/:collection/` by default

Maybe someday mocki will grow up to accept handy options like a routes hash that just provide actions...  
or maybe remain a little script that's happy to stick with a simple convention.

mocki has less that 1/1000th the coolness of [nock](https://github.com/flatiron/nock), but I wanted persistence and to learn stuff.

---------------

### usage

create directories for collections to store json files.
e.g. `test/fixtures/slayer-albums`

place your fixture/mock files in the collection folders named by id.  
e.g. `south-of-heaven.json`



#### `using` in an existing app

    var http = require('http'),
        express = require('express'),
        mocki = require('mocki');
    //...
    app.use('/api', mocki()); // mocki to handle routes to /api
    //...
    http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
      console.log("mock routes mounted on /api");
    });

the [standalone server](server.js) does just that.

#### running as a stand-alone express app

`$ npm start`  
`mocki mounted at: http://localhost:8000/api`  

then, start sending your xhr requests to the hosted url:

    var SlayerAlbums = Backbone.Collection.extend({
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/api/slayer-albums',
      ...
    });
    var slayer = new SlayerAlbums();
    slayer.fetch()

Origin headers are set to allow CORS.

###routes

GET /api/:collection  
lists an array of models created from `*.json` files in collection dir.  
alternatively serves a `list.json` instead of one file per model.

GET /api/:collection/:id  
shows a `:id.json` file

POST /api/:collection  
generates a unique id and saves to an `:id.json` file

PUT /api/:collection/:id  
updates an `:id.json` file

DELETE /api/:collection/:id  
deletes `:id.json` file

All verbs are repeated for a nested resources  
[VERB] /api/:collection/:id/:subcollection
