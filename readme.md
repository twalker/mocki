##ðŸ˜Œ  mocki
a little server of mock json files for backbone models/collections.  
mocki saves files in `mocks/` + collectionname.  

mocki has less that 1/1000th the coolness of [nock](https://github.com/flatiron/nock), but I wanted persistence.

---------------

###routes

GET collection/:id?
	- list: dynamically return an json array of each file in dir.
	- show if id provided
		if file, return the file

POST collection/
	- create: save an `id.json` file

PUT collection/id
	- update: save an `id.json` file and reflect the json sent
	
DELETE collection/id
	- destroy: delete `id.json` file


---------------
###example usage
run the mocki server:  `node app`

in the client express app, forward proxy the desired requests, e.g. /api/*
		
		// proxy api requests to mocki when in "test" mode
		app.configure('test', function () {	
			var proxy = new httpProxy.RoutingProxy();
			app.set('trust proxy', true);
			app.all("/api/*", function(req, res){
				// trim urls for mocki, url should start with collection name
				req.url = req.url.replace(/^.+api\//, '/');
				proxy.proxyRequest(req, res, {
					host: 'localhost',
					port: 8000
				});
			});
		});

###big todo:

need to figure out how exactly I want to use it in app before I get too far. 
 I want to use it to swap out for the real restful resource api based on NODE_ENV.  
 Stand alone server or middleware?  
 If middleware, mocki I can use it per collection and let the routing be handled by the consuming app. mocki just responds, let the client determine which requests to forward.

####problems:

- same origin policy restricts to the same port that the client's using. should look into cors.
- when using a proxy in the client, express.bodyParser() changes the request to where http-proxy doesn't forward POST, DELETE, UPDATE requests properly [more info](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/180). The fix is to register the middleware before the bodyParser.

###smaller todo: 

- handle case of serving list.json.
- figure out how better way to deal with namespacing for 'api', should be an option.
- figure out how to deal with options (mock dir, base api path)
- better deal with throwing errors--need to understand best practice.
