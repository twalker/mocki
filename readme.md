## ðŸ˜Œ  mocki

an little server of mock json files for backbone models & collections. 
It can be mounted by an existing express app or run as a standalone server.

it serves json files in `test/fixtures/:collection` by default

maybe someday mocki will grow up to be a grunt task, or accept handy options like a routes hash, or just provide actions...  or maybe remain a happy little script. 

mocki has less that 1/1000th the coolness of [nock](https://github.com/flatiron/nock), but I wanted persistence and to learn stuff. 

---------------

### usage

create directories for collections to store json files. 
e.g. `test/fixtures/slayer-albums`

place your fixture/mock files in the collection folders named by id.  
e.g. `123.json`

#### mounting as an sub-app

to **mount** mocki, copy `routes/mocki.js` and use as middleware in a hosting express app:

		var http = require('http'),
				express = require('express'),
				mocki = require('./routes/mocki');
		//...
		app.use('/api', mocki()); // mount mocks at /api
		//...
		http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
			console.log("mock routes mounted on /api");
		});

the [standalone server](app.js) does just that.

#### running as a stand-alone express app

`$ npm start`  

	mocki mounted at: http://localhost:8000/api

then, start sending your xhr requests to the hosted url:

		Backbone.Collection.extend({
			url: 'http://localhost:8000/api',
			...
		});

Origin headers are set to allow CORS.

###routes

GET /api/:collection  
lists an array of models created from `*.json` files in collection dir.  
alternatively serves a `list.json` instead of one file per model.

GET /api/:collection/:id  
shows a `:id.json` file

POST /api/:collection  
generates a unique id and saves to an `:id.json` file

PUT /api/:collection/:id  
updates an `:id.json` file
	
DELETE /api/:collection/:id  
deletes `:id.json` file

All verbs are repeated for a nested resources  
[VERB] /api/:collection/:id/:subcollection

## messy notes from mocki's adventures


### TODO

-- double check error handling best practice
- clean up this mess of a readme

need to figure out how exactly I want to use it in app before I get too far. 
I want to use it to swap out for the real restful resource api based on NODE_ENV.  
Stand alone server or middleware?  
If middleware, I can use it per collection and let the routing be handled by the consuming app. mocki just responds and lets the client determine which requests to forward.

My cat sniffed this work, and typed:
